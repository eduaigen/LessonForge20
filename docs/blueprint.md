## Style Guidelines:

- A vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to evoke a sense of trust, knowledge, and innovation, critical for an educational tool.
- A very light blue (#E1F5FE), almost white, to provide a clean and non-distracting background that supports readability.
- A lively green (#90EE90) as an analogous hue to the primary blue, conveying growth and progress in learning. Use this color for key interactive elements, such as buttons.
- 'Inter', a sans-serif typeface, chosen for its clear and modern appearance, suitable for body text and interface elements.
- 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif typeface, chosen for its slightly more expressive and contemporary design; complements Inter well in a pairing.
- Use clear and intuitive icons that represent educational concepts and actions within the app. Ensure icons are consistent in style and align with the overall clean aesthetic.
- Employ a clean, intuitive layout with clear visual hierarchy. Important actions and information should be easily accessible. The layout should be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.
