Your task is to take the following student worksheet, provided as a JSON object, and regenerate it with built-in scaffolds. Do not change the core activities, but enhance them to be more accessible.

**Original Worksheet JSON:**
---
{{{worksheetJson}}}
---

**Scaffolding Instructions:**
1.  **Preserve JSON Structure:** You MUST return a JSON object with the exact same structure as the input.
2.  **Simplify Language:** Review all string values (instructions, questions, etc.). Rephrase complex sentences into simpler, more direct language where possible without losing academic rigor.
3.  **Add Sentence Starters:** For all open-ended questions, short responses, and reasoning prompts (like in a CER), provide sentence starters or frames in a logical place.
    *   Example: For a question like "Explain your reasoning," modify the field to include something like: "Explain your reasoning. You can start with: 'I think this because... The evidence that supports my idea is...'"
4.  **Chunk Instructions:** Break down multi-step instructions into numbered or bulleted lists within their respective JSON string values.
5.  **Define Key Vocabulary:** For key vocabulary sections, add a Spanish translation to the definition string.
    *   Example: "Photosynthesis: The process plants use to make food (Spanish: FotosÃ­ntesis)."
6.  **Add Visual Cue Placeholders:** Where a concept is particularly abstract or complex (e.g., cell diagrams, feedback loops), insert a placeholder in a relevant string field to indicate where a teacher could add a visual aid.
    *   Example: "[Visual Aid: A simple diagram showing the flow of energy from the sun to plants.]"
7.  **Format for Clarity:** Use Markdown within the JSON string values (bolding, italics, lists) to make the worksheet easy to navigate.

Generate the full, scaffolded version of the worksheet as a JSON object.`,
